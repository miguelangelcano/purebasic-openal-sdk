# OpenAL v1.0 and v1.1 SDK for PureBasic, 32-bit (Windows)

**Note:** Tested with PureBasic versions up to 6.10 LTS. PureBasic v6.11
and newer are not currently supported due to incompatibilities  with
the linker.  

Make sure you have OpenAL installed before running the included
examples. The redistributable OpenAL installer is available at the
official [OpenAL website](https://www.openal.org/downloads/).
[Mirror](http://web.archive.org/web/20080523200706/developer.creative.com/landing.asp?cat=1&sbcat=31&top=38).  

Current release contains a complete  OpenAL API reference, which you
can copy to your PureBasic Help directory to enable inline access
from the IDE.  

The OpenAL PureLib should be copied to  
```[PureBasic]\PureLibraries\UserLibraries```  
before compiling the included examples. Refer to samples\readme.txt
for more information about the example programs.
